##  About Me

I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer and Computer Science student dedicated to building scalable, efficient applications that solve real-world problems. I specialize in Java Spring Boot backend development, React frontend design, and have strong expertise in Data Structures & Algorithms.

I love creating complete end-to-end solutions with clean code architecture, proper API design, and intuitive user interfaces. My recent projects demonstrate my ability to handle the full development lifecycle—from database design to deployment.

Currently working on: User Management System (Android + Spring Boot full-stack application)

Always learning: Advanced system design patterns, microservices architecture, cloud deployment
